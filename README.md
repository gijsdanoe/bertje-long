# BERTje-long
Repository for the masterthesis 'BERTje-long: the Dutch long-document Transformer' by Gijs Danoe. In this thesis both BERTje and RobBERT have been converted to Longformers to be able to process 4096 tokens instead of 512. These models have been tested against the normal BERTje, RobBERT and Pino (Dutch BigBird) on multiple tasks which include sentiment analysis, mask filling and coreference resolution.

## Installation
1. (Optionally) create a virtual environment for this project (tested on python 3.8+)
